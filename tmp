You have access to both StB repos:
 - backend:`~/dev/stb_simplified` 
 - frontend:`~/dev/jan-testing-hub-109e38bc`
 
 As well as the monitoring repo:
 - `~/dev/gpu_graph` 


Primary objective:
Confirm whether the current monitor is effective for this practical requirement:
- Cloud LLM prompts/responses produce external traffic spikes.
- Local-model prompts/responses produce no meaningful external traffic.
- Therefore, local-model usage is not leaking externally under normal operation.

Artifacts to inspect:
- `stb_netacct_terminal_graph.py`
- `stb_netacct/iptables/stb_netacct_rules.sh`
- `stb_netacct/iptables/stb_netacct_export.py`
- `stb_netacct/systemd/stb-netacct.service`
- `mon_gpu_net` (current launcher)
- `mon_gpu_net_all.sh` (legacy, total traffic monitor)

Tasks (required):
1) Verify monitor plumbing end-to-end
- Confirm counters source, update cadence, and what exactly is counted/excluded.
- Confirm cgroup/service coverage for StB runtime components and subprocesses.

2) Verify LLM traffic behavior empirically
- Run controlled test matrix with timestamps:
  - Cloud LLM request(s): expect clear spikes during prompt/response window.
  - Local LLM request(s): expect near-zero external deltas.
- Capture objective evidence (commands, logs, counter snapshots, timing alignment).

3) Rule out obvious confounders
- Identify other StB/non-StB traffic sources that could mimic spikes.
- State whether observed spike patterns are specific enough to support the leakage claim.

4) Deliver verdict
- “Confirmed”, “Partially confirmed”, or “Not confirmed”.
- Confidence 0–100% with rationale.
- If gaps remain, propose the smallest next step to close them (minimal code/config change).

Output format:
- Findings first (severity ordered), each with claim + evidence + impact.
- Then verdict/confidence.
- Then minimal remediation (if needed).

Decision criteria to use:
- Confirmed if repeated cloud tests consistently spike and repeated local tests remain flat within a small baseline/noise threshold.
- Not confirmed if local-mode tests show unexplained external deltas or cloud/local cannot be reliably distinguished.
